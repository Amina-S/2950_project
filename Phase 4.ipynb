    "The purpose of this report is to utilize data publicly available on Piazza.com and ratemyprofessors.com to answer the question: \"What makes a class good?\". We use ratings for professors as a general indicator of how positive or negative the average student's experience was with the professor for a particular course for a particular semester, and look for patterns between good ratings and other observations in our data. Variables like class size (reflected by the Piazza enrollment), average percentage of the class engaging on Piazza, course level, and average instructor response time on Piazza are all analyzed. "

    "We primarily use web scraping to acquire data and store it in two tables.\n",
    "#### Data acquisition and cleaning: \n",
    "\n",
    "**piazza.com** \n",
    "* See \"piazza_data_collect.ipynb\"\n",
    "* Every course on Piazza has a stats report accessible to anyone enrolled in the class (under the statistics tab). A few courses do not have this report because there was not enough piazza activity. \n",
    "* We compiled a list of courses (with no duplicates) from various departments taught in various semesters that used piazza.com as an interactive platform. For each of these courses, we recorded the URL for its stats page in the file \"piazza_stats.txt\". Here we also manually added the semester corresponding to each stats report. We then iterated through each of the URLs in the file and recorded in [ piazza .csv ] various attributes for each course\n",
    "* As of now, some of our piazza stats course names are irregular. Because there is only a small number of these irregularities and they don't follow any particular pattern, we chose to manually fix each one\n",
    "* We also need to get rid of the '%' following the values in columns \"% response\" and \"instructor_response\"\n",
    "* We also want to be able to group our courses by departments\n",
    "\n",
    "**ratemyprofessors.com** \n",
    "* See \"data_collect.ipymb\"\n",
    "* We manually associate each course element of our piazza.csv database with the name of the professor who taught it that semester. We then manually aqcuire the URLs of the associated ratemyprofessors.com page of each of these professors and record them in the file \"Rate_my_prof.txt\". We then iterate through each URL in this file and scrape the necessary attributes for each review for the course we are looking for.\n",
    "* Because a review page for a professor includes many \n",
    "* Some ratemyprofessors.com reviews are void because when they were scraped the ads on the page corrupted some of the observations\n",
    "    - So we need to remove these observations. Every review is guaranteed to have a quality rating\n",
    "    - Because the course names are listed as a single string, we need to split the department name and course number and delete reviews with typos in the course name\n",
