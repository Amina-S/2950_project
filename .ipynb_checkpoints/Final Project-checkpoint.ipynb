    "\n",
    "The purpose of this report is to utilize data publicly available on [piazza.com](https://piazza.com/) and [ratemyprofessors.com](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) to answer the question: \"What makes a class good?\". We use ratings for professors as a general indicator of how positive or negative the average student's experience was with the professor for a particular course for a particular semester, and look for patterns between good ratings and other observations in our data. Variables like class size (reflected by the Piazza enrollment), average percentage of the class engaging on Piazza, course level, and average instructor response time on Piazza are all analyzed. \n",
    "Maximizing learning and improving the student experience in a class should always be a prioritiy of instructors. If this investigation shows that behaviors like encouraging student engagement on piazza.com, responding to piazza questions in a timely manner, and limiting class sizes significantly correlates with higher student ratings of a class, this information can be used to improve student satisfaction and learning for a large range of courses both at Cornell and elsewhere. Especially now in the shift to online learning, resources such as piazza.com are becoming one of the only ways some students have of getting help in and engaging in a course, so it is only more important now to understand the its impact in learning.\n",

    "#### Data acquisition\n",
    "*see [web scraping code appendix](Appendix2.ipynb)*\n",
    "##### **piazza.com** \n",
    "* See [piazza_data_collect.ipynb](piazza_data_collect.ipynb) \n",
    "* Every course on Piazza has a stats report accessible to anyone enrolled in the class (under the statistics tab). A few courses do not have this report because there was not enough piazza activity. \n",
    "* We compiled a list of courses (with no duplicates) from various departments taught in various semesters that used piazza.com as an interactive platform. For each of these courses, we recorded the URL for its stats page in the file \"piazza_stats.txt\". Here we also manually added the semester corresponding to each stats report. We then iterated through each of the URLs in the file and recorded in \"piazza .csv\" various attributes for each course\n",
    "* As of now, some of our piazza stats course names are irregular. Because there is only a small number of these irregularities and they don't follow any particular pattern, we chose to manually fix each one\n",
    "* We also need to get rid of the '%' following the values in columns \"% response\" and \"instructor_response\"\n",
    "* We also want to be able to group our courses by departments\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **ratemyprofessors.com** \n",
    "* See [data_collect.ipynb](data_collect.ipynb)\n",
    "* We manually associate each course element of our piazza.csv database with the name of the professor who taught it that semester. We then manually aqcuire the URLs of the associated ratemyprofessors.com page of each of these professors and record them in the file \"Rate_my_prof.txt\". We then iterate through each URL in this file and scrape the necessary attributes for each review for the course we are looking for.\n",
    "* Because a review page for a professor includes many \n",
    "* Some ratemyprofessors.com reviews are void because when they were scraped the ads on the page corrupted some of the observations\n",
    "    - So we need to remove these observations. Every review is guaranteed to have a quality rating\n",
    "    - Because the course names are listed as a single string, we need to split the department name and course number and delete reviews with typos in the course name\n",
    "    - We also need to convert columns that hold number values from string to int (eg, Difficulty)\n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preprocessing and cleaning\n",
    "See [Data collection and cleaning appendix](Appendix.ipynb)\n",
    "* Piazza data:\n",
    "    * Some of our course names had irregularities when we scraped directly from the stats pages(eg, having the semester included in the name). Because we had relatively few of these cases in our ~50 courses, we manually adjusted these names to be of the form DEPT####.\n",
    "    * We went through the columns that were supposed to hold numerical values and converted them from strings to ints or floats, as appropriate, and removed preceding \"%\" signs as needed\n",
    "    * Because we were interested in data such as the course level and department, we created two more columns by splitting the course name into its numerical and departmental values, eg) \"CS3110\" -> \"CS\", 3110\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Ratemyprofessors data:\n",
    "    * Some entries had only the instructor name and null values for all fields. This was caused by ads on the page being picked up by our scraping code. So we deleted all entries that did not have the \"quality\" field because every review was required to have a value for the quality rating.\n",
    "    * Many reviews had typos in the course names (eg, \"CS111\" instead of \"CS1110\"). Also, there were some courses whos instructor had very few reviews. We resolved both of these issues at once my only including a review if at least 4 other reviews had the same course name. So, reviews for courses with 4 or fewer reviews were not included (to get a larger data sample and more accurate analysis) and reviews with misspelled course names were not included to minimize ambiguity (because there were far too many reviews to manually correct typos for).\n",
    "    * We went through the columns that were supposed to hold numerical values and converted them from strings to ints or floats, as appropriate\n",
    "    \n",
    " * Merging into all_data:\n",
    "     * To easily cross analyze our two sets of data, we did an inner merge of our ratings and piazza data on both the name of the instructor and the name of the course taught. We then did a little column renaming and dropping to tidy up redundencies and inconsistencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Raw data\n",

    "* Manually entered: \n",
    "    - [piazza_links.txt](piazza_links.txt)\n",

    "#### Potential drawbacks and limitations\n",
    "* While we did manage to get data corresponding to a wide variety of courses, including Econ, CS, and Physics, we did not have many of each kind of course. Particularly, we do not have enough to be able to look at potential trends across departments like we had hoped.\n",
    "* A couple classes had two instructors. Because we did not know how to logically deal with this, we chose the instructor who taught the most lectures, determined by asking the students who took such classes. \n",
